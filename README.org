* Introduction

Niccolo' is  a web based software  aimed at safe chemicals  storage, using and
disposing.

* Building
  Niccolo' is  written in Common Lisp,  except for a couple  of library
  (written in C) it depends on.

** Dependency
*** Library
  Niccolo' depend on the following common lisp libraries:

  - alexandria;
  - cl-ppcre-unicode;
  - dbi;
  - envy;
  - parse-number;
  - xmls;
  - html-template;
  - cl-base64;
  - osicat;
  - log4cl;
  - ironclad;
  - cl-who;
  - cl-json;
  - flexi-streams;
  - cl-gd;
  - hunchentoot;
  - restas;
  - restas-directory-publisher;
  - cl-pslib;
  - cl-pslib-barcode;
  - cl-i18n;
  - crane.

  Except for  crane (see below) all  of them are  available from  quicklisp.

  For crane a patched version (available [[https://github.com/cage2/crane/tree/sqlite][here]]), is needed.

  Also be sure to install the following C libraries:

  - libgd;
  - libsqlite3;
  - pslib.

*** External programs
    - sbcl;
    - wget;
    - sqlite3;
    - screen;
    - gcc;
    - bash;
    - qrencode;
    - autotools build system (i.e. autoconf, automake etc).

** Installation

Note: Assuming directory ~/lisp exists and is writable.

Also     basic     [[https://www.common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]] knowledge is mandatory.

Moreover  steps 6-12  should  be  skipped if  you  have quicklisp  already
installed  and  ASDF  configured  (but  you  should  install  all  the
[[dependency]] anyway, via quiciklisp).

1. cd ~/lisp/
2. clone niccolo repository;
3. cd niccolo
4. autoreconf -fiv
5. ./configure
6. cd ..
7. wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
8. wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp.asc
9. wget https://beta.quicklisp.org/release-key.txt
10. check quicklisp gpg key
11. cd niccolo
12. bash ./quick_quicklisp.sh (the script will download and install most of the libraries, also will help you to configure ASDF);
13. clone [[https://github.com/cage2/crane/tree/sqlite][this version of crane]] in  ~/quicklisp/local-projects;
14. cd ~/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/cl-gd-0.6.1
15. make
16. cd ~/lisp/niccolo/
17. make
18. put your ssl certificate in ssl/
19. edit config.lisp
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(define-constant +path-prefix+ "/niccolo" :test #'string=)

;; ssl

(define-constant +hostname+   "xxxxxxxxx" :test #'string=)

(defparameter *ssl-certfile* (asdf:system-relative-pathname :lab #p"ssl/xxx.pem"))

(defparameter *ssl-key* (asdf:system-relative-pathname :lab #p"ssl/xxxx.pem"))

(define-constant +ssl-pass+   "xxxxxx" :test #'string=)

#+END_SRC
20. Optional (but *strongly* recommended), use CAS autentication

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; cas config

(define-constant +cas-server-host-name+    "" :test #'string=)

(define-constant +cas-server-path-prefix+  ""    :test #'string=)
#+END_SRC

   you need to compile mini-cas library to use this feature see: [[CAS authentication]] below.

21. Optional (but *strongly* recommended)
    If you plan to put niccolo behind a revers proxy (and we recommend to do so) also set:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(define-constant +https-poxy-port+ -1 :test #'=)
#+END_SRC

    to the actual port (usually 443) where your http server is listening on the internet/intranet.

22. sh start_server.sh
23. point your browser to
    https://\+hostname\+:(\+https-poxy-port\+|\+https-port\+)/\+path-prefix\+/add-admin/
    where \+hostname\+  and \+path-prefix\+ are the values  of the variables setted  in point
    19, also specify  the actual port your server is  listening on the
    internet (\+https-poxy-port\+ or \+https-port\+) to generate the administrator account.

* Authentication
 Niccolo comes with two kinds of autenthication mechanisms.

** Internal database of users
 The first is based on an table in its own database which stores username/password.

 We *does not*  recommend using this kind of authentication  as it was
 developed just for testing purposes.

** CAS authentication

   Niccolo includes a  [[https://github.com/Jasig/cas/blob/master/cas-server-documentation/protocol/CAS-Protocol-Specification.md][CAS]] client library (in  .../lib/ directory) for
   authentication, this is what we use in our production environment.

   To enable CAS authentication just  put the mini-cas directory in a
   place where ASDF is  going to be able to find  it, niccolo will use
   CAS automatically. Then edit config.lisp in the CAS section.

   If  mini-cas is  not available  to ASDF  niccolo' will  use internal
   authentication instead.

   Please   note   that,   depending    of   the   content   of   your
   source-registry.conf  file   (expecially  if  you  use   the  :tree
   options), .../lib/mini-cas/ *will* be reached by ASDF.
